# 🏚️ OBUA – Operations in Built-Up Areas

Urban warfare demands coordination:

- Room-to-room and floor-to-floor tactics
- Cover movement between buildings
- Bounding overwatch on streets and alleyways
- Civilian interaction SOP
- ROE: Proportionate force, target discrimination

Always expect resistance from above, below, or behind.
