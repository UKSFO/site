# ðŸª– Battle Drills (PreSAR)

UKSF(O) Battle Drills are based on the PRE-SAR model:

- **Prepare**: Kit checks, loadout configuration, FUP (Form-Up Point) brief.
- **React**: Return fire, find cover, gain situational awareness.
- **Establish Fire Superiority**: Identify, suppress, and fix enemy.
- **Suppress**: Coordinated fire using cover and movement.
- **Assault**: Flank or breach once superiority is confirmed.
- **Re-org**: Consolidate, resupply, redistribute ammo and medics.

These drills are rehearsed in every patrol and executed under pressure.
