# ðŸŽ¯ JTAC / FAC SOP

JTACs control air power with precision:

- 9-Line CAS requests
- Danger close acknowledgment
- Laser designation (IR, visible) protocols
- Grid reference: MGRS standard with TacMap overlays
- Deconflict air and ground assets via timing and altitude
- Drone/UAV feeds used for BDA and target ID

Friendly air assets donâ€™t ask questionsâ€”be sure before you clear them hot.
