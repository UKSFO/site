# 🚁 Boarding & Debussing Aircraft

- Always approach from 3/9 o’clock unless otherwise briefed.
- Rotor awareness: Head down, weapon low.
- 5-second debus rule: Move away from LZ and take cover.
- Fire support from aircraft = danger-close zones marked on TacMap.
- Use smoke for LZ marking in low-vis.

If it flies, it’s either transport or trouble.
